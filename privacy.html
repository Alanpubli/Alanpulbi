		DATA PROTECTION<br />

		We treat personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this data protection declaration.

		As a rule, our website can be used without entering personal data.
		Insofar as personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without our express consent. <br />

		When visiting our website, the name of the Internet service provider used, the data transmitted by the browser and the websites visited are generally transmitted. We use Google Analytics (see below) to evaluate this information for statistical purposes.

		We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can be subject to security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible. <br />
		<br /><br />
		COOKIES<br />

		Some of the Internet pages use so-called cookies. Cookies do not damage the computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies are used to make our website more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on the computer.

		Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your terminal until they are deleted. These cookies enable us to recognize the browser the next time you visit.

		The browser can be set in such a way that it informs you when cookies are set and only permits cookies in individual cases; it accepts cookies for certain cases or generally excludes them and activates the automatic deletion of cookies when the browser is closed. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be restricted.
		<br /><br />
		HOSTING<br />

		Our online offer is hosted by Github. Further information can be found in Github's privacy policy at:
    https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-privacy-statement
		<br /><br />
		COLLECTION OF ACCESS DATA AND LOGFILES<br />

		We or our hosting provider, as the case may be, raise a claim for the protection of legitimate interests within the meaning of  GDPR data about each access to the server on which this service is located (so-called server log files). The access data includes the name of the website accessed, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider. The legitimate interests are: Elimination of disturbances, guarantee of IT security, prosecution of illegal uses of the online offer.

		Log file information is stored for a maximum period of seven days and then deleted. Data, the further storage of which is necessary for evidence purposes, is excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.
		<br /><br />
		CONTACT FORM<br />

		If the contact form is used for inquiries, then these data from the inquiry form are stored including the contact data indicated there
    for the purpose of treatment of the inquiry and for the case of follow-up questions with us.

    If you use the contact formon our website, the information you submit is collected by:
    Formspree.io, subject to its Terms and Privacy Policy
    Note that Formspree.io only saves the most recent 100 messages.
    After that, messages are deleted.
    Further information can be found in Formspree's privacy policy at: https://docs.formspree.io/files/privacy.pdf

    <br /><br />
		NEWSLETTER DATA<br />

		If the newsletter offered on the website is received, we need contact addresses and information that allows us to check it. We use these data exclusively for the dispatch of the requested information and do not pass them on to third parties.
		<br /><br />
		WHATSAPP NEWSLETTER<br />

		We store subscriber contact information anonymously on an Internet-enabled IPhone smartphone from which we send the WhatsApp newsletter.
    Subscription is done through the Double Opt In process. A backup of the contact data is stored on a private Apple address book.
    We store only the information that is publicly available to contacts at WhatsApp.
    Usually this is the WhatsApp username, profile picture, current WhatApp status and mobile phone number -
    in some cases the clear name, if given.

		To unsubscribe from the newsletter please send a WhatsApp message with "STOP NEWSLETTER". We will then delete both the local data on the smartphone and the data on the Google address book and drive account. We do not pass on data from subscribers to third parties and use them only in the context of the newsletter.
		<br /><br />
		E-MAIL NEWSLETTER<br />

		We use the service https://mailchimp.com/ from the USA to send the e-mail newsletter. The confirmation of the subscription takes place after the Double Opt In procedure. Further data, which Mailchimp requests in the course of the subscription, will only be stored by Mailchimp. Furthermore, reading habits of the subscribers are recorded, for example clicks on links and used to optimize our e-mail newsletter.

		To unsubscribe from the newsletter, please use the link in each newsletter footer. Mailchimp promises to automatically delete all collected data afterwards. We will then no longer have access to it.
		<br /><br/>

		BUSINESS CARDS<br />

		If business cards are handed over to us, we assume that the issuer wishes to be contacted by us. In this case we will use the information contained on the business card. This may include name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. We may even store this information on our smartphone.
		<br /><br />
		GOOGLE ANALYTICS<br />
